A micro-asset investment, allocation, and trade simulator.

## Quick start

## `sim-exchange` structure and architecture

This project consists of three portions, a `backend`, a `frontend`, and
a `research` portion with a statistical API, deployed from the 
`research/models` directory. 

Each portion has its own build and development process and should be 
individually considered as separate, modular applications which together
produce the client application as a whole.

### `backend/` - deployed @ Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

### `frontend/` - deployed @ Zeit.co

### `research/` - `research/models/` APIs deployed @ GCP
